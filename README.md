# ThermPy1D
Tools to provide analytical and semi-discrete solutions to radial and linear heat transfer problems with internal heat generation.
See the Jupyter notebooks and example scripts for examples of how to generate, visualise and export results.

Please verify that this 1-D analytical tool is suitable for your purposes and exercise due dilligence to verify the results. 

Future work may include:
	-The addition of a notebook showing the mathematics behind deriving and solving the systems of equations.
	-Unit testing to ensure all areas of functionality work and that script performs well for known results.
	-Colour map plot of temperature through 2D pipe cross section (because it would look cool).
	-Adding an iterative solver to deal with temperature dependant conductivity.
	-Spherical heat transfer (e.g. for pebble beds).
