# RadialExact1D
Tools to provide analytical and semi-discrete solutions to radial heat transfer problems with internal heat generation.
See the Jupyter notebooks and example scripts for examples of how to generate, visualise and export results.
The Theory notebook runs you through the theory development of how to solve these 1D systems.
